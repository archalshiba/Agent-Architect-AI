Your task is to create a React component and integrate it into a Next.js page.\nUSER:\n1.  **Create the `ProfileSettingsForm` React component:**\n    -   **File Path:** `/user/src/components/profile-settings-form.tsx`\n    -   **Specification:** \"Develop a multi-section form for user settings. Sections should include 'Profile Information' (e.g., name, email), 'Password Settings' (old password, new password, confirm new password), and potentially 'Subscription Details' (placeholder for future). Each section should have its own save button. Use a tabbed or accordion interface for navigation between sections. Apply Tailwind CSS for a professional look.\"\n    -   **Implementation Details:**\n        -   Use React hooks (`useState`) for managing form input values and active tab.\n        -   The form should have two main sections: \"Profile Information\" and \"Password Settings\".\n        -   For \"Profile Information\", include input fields for `Email` (read-only initially, as it's from auth) and `Name` (editable, placeholder for future user model extension).\n        -   For \"Password Settings\", include input fields for `Current Password`, `New Password`, and `Confirm New Password`.\n        -   Implement a basic tab navigation (e.g., using buttons or `div` elements styled as tabs) to switch between these sections.\n        -   Each section should have its own \"Save Changes\" button, which would ideally trigger an API call (though the API integration itself is not part of this task, just the button).\n        -   Style the form using Tailwind CSS for a modern, clean, card-like appearance, ensuring responsiveness.\n        -   Do not implement actual API calls in this task; just the UI and local state management.\n\n2.  **Create and integrate into the Next.js page:**\n    -   **File Path:** `/user/src/app/settings/page.tsx`\n    -   **Instructions:**\n        -   Create a default exported React component named `SettingsPage`.\n        -   Import the `ProfileSettingsForm` component.\n        -   Render the `ProfileSettingsForm` component within a main container (e.g., `div` with `container mx-auto p-4`).\n        -   Add an `h1` heading at the top of the page: \"Account Settings\".\n        -   Ensure the page structure and styling are consistent with other pages in the application."}
