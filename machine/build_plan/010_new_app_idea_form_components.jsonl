Your task is to implement the 'Multi-Step Form Container' component as described in the manifest, and integrate it into the dedicated page.\n\nRead the following component specification from the 'new-app-idea-form-page' section in `/machine/manifest.json`:\nCOMPONENT ID: multi-step-form-container\nNAME: Multi-Step Form Container\nSPECIFICATION: \"Build a multi-step form layout. It needs a clear progress indicator (e.g., numbered steps or a progress bar) at the top. Each step should present relevant input fields for 'Purpose', 'Target Audience', 'Core Features', 'Desired Tech Stack', and 'Existing Resources'. Include 'Back' and 'Next' navigation buttons, and a 'Submit' button on the final step. Ensure input fields are clearly labeled and have appropriate input types (e.g., textarea for longer descriptions). Use Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness.\"\n\nAdditionally, consider the 'AppIdea' data model in `/machine/manifest.json`. The form should capture a 'title' field as well, in addition to the fields mentioned in the component specification.\n\nUSER: First, create a new React component file at `user/src/components/MultiStepAppIdeaForm.tsx`. This component should implement the multi-step form layout as described. It must include:\n1.  A clear progress indicator at the top, showing the current step.\n2.  Separate steps for input fields, including:\n    *   Step 1: 'Title' and 'Purpose'\n    *   Step 2: 'Target Audience' and 'Core Features'\n    *   Step 3: 'Desired Tech Stack' and 'Existing Resources'\n3.  Navigation buttons ('Back' and 'Next') between steps.\n4.  A 'Submit' button on the final step.\n5.  Internal state management for the form fields and current step.\n6.  Use Tailwind CSS for all styling to ensure responsiveness and a modern look.\n\nSecond, modify the page file at `user/src/app/new-idea/page.tsx`. This page should import and render your `MultiStepAppIdeaForm` component. For now, the form's `onSubmit` handler should simply log the collected form data to the console, as the backend integration will be handled in a subsequent task. Focus on the frontend UI and form state management."}
